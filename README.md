Logistics Model
Logistics Optimization Project Overview: This project aims to optimize logistic processes for NovaTrade Brazil by leveraging advanced data analytics techniques. By accurately forecasting daily order volumes and segmenting operational days based on key characteristics, this project provides actionable insights to improve resource allocation, streamline operations, and enhance decision-making.

Objectives • Predict Daily Order Volumes: Use machine learning models to forecast order demand and enable efficient inventory and staffing management. • Categorize Operational Days: Classify days into low, medium, or high order volumes to tailor logistic strategies for each segment. • Enhance Operational Efficiency: Provide NovaTrade Brazil with tools to minimize costs and maximize resource utilization.

Dataset: The dataset includes 60 days of logistic operations, featuring 12 predictive attributes such as: • Order urgency levels • Order types (e.g., fiscal, banking) • Sector-specific order counts

The dataset was clean and structured, allowing for effective regression and classification analysis.

Methodology

1. Data Analysis and Preparation • Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and characteristics. • Standardized and encoded features for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

2. Classification • Decision Tree: Achieved 75% accuracy in predicting low, medium, or high order days. • Naive Bayes: Achieved 100% accuracy but raised concerns of overfitting due to the small dataset size.

3. Regression • Linear Regression: Produced an R² score of 1.0, indicating potential data leakage or overfitting. • Random Forest Regression: Achieved realistic predictions with an R² score of 0.724, explaining 72% of variability in daily orders.

4. Clustering • K-Means Clustering: Segmented operational days into three distinct clusters, providing insights into patterns like peak order days and resource-intensive periods. • Hierarchical Clustering: Visualized nested patterns and relationships for strategic planning.

Results • Prediction Accuracy: Decision Tree models provided actionable insights, while Random Forest Regression delivered realistic and scalable forecasts. • Operational Insights: Clustering identified unique daily patterns, enabling tailored strategies for high-demand periods.

Technologies Used • Programming: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn • Tools: Jupyter Notebook • Machine Learning Techniques: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

Key Accomplishments • Achieved a 75% accuracy rate using Decision Tree classification. • Enhanced logistic planning by identifying patterns with clustering techniques. • Reduced inventory management inefficiencies by providing actionable insights.

Future Recommendations • Expand Dataset: A larger dataset would improve model generalization and reduce overfitting risks. • Implement Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to enhance model robustness and mitigate overfitting concerns. • Continuous Feature Refinement: Explore additional features and advanced machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
